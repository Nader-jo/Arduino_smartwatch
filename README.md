This is a basic smartwatch concept that runs on arduino mini pro (ATmega328).

It has a 128*128 pixel, 1.44 inch colorful tft display, a small vibrator, a high intensity LED, a 1000 mah lipo battery.

It includes many features like:
- Setting the time
- Having 2 watch faces ( analog / digital)
- Setting an alarm ( with vibrator )
- Torch light
- built-in chronometer
- a flappy bird clone game

It is still missing the bluetooth feature to connect with a smartphone and to display notifications.  

I have made some demo videos of the smartwatch working :

The code is not well optimized, it currently uses almost all of the ATmega328 resources.
